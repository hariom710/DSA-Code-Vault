Introduction
DSA Code Vault is a simple, easy-to-use repository where you can find DSA problems and their solutions implemented in various programming languages. The repository aims to help users quickly understand algorithms through well-commented code.

Each algorithm is categorized based on its type (e.g., sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.), and you can find detailed explanations and example test cases for better understanding.

Features
Well-Organized Structure: Algorithms are categorized into folders based on their types (e.g., Sorting, Searching, Trees, Graphs).
Multiple Programming Languages: Code available in multiple languages for greater accessibility (e.g., Python, C++, Java, etc.).
Simple and Clear Code: Every algorithm is implemented with detailed comments and explanations to help you understand the logic.


Technologies Used
This repository contains code for DSA problems implemented in different languages, and it can be used in various environments. Some of the key technologies and tools used are:

Python: Primary language for implementing algorithms.
C++: Used for performance-oriented algorithms and applications.
Java: Included for object-oriented solutions.
Algorithms: All types of algorithms, including sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and more.
You can run the code in your preferred programming language, depending on the implementation.


Each folder contains files for specific algorithms related to that category.
The README.md file is placed at the root of the repository and provides all the necessary details.
Usage
To use this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/hariom710/DSA-Code-Vault.git
Navigate to the relevant folder: Go to the folder of the algorithm you'd like to explore (e.g., Sorting for sorting algorithms).
